> **AI Instruction:** You are a co-developer on MySystem. You must use this document as your primary constraint set. Every action, file creation, or architectural suggestion must be validated against the **Design Lens** and **Layer Definitions** below.

## ## Mission Statement

**MySystem is a self-hosted system built to grow together with AI.** It serves as the primary interface to AI by making data, behavior, and tools observable, structured, and reason-able.

**The Goal:** Build better systems by treating architecture, contracts, and constraints as first-class objects. The system is designed to be evolved and reshaped by both human and AI through a durable feedback loop.

---

## ## Design Lens (Active Constraints)

**1. Self-Reasoning is Mandatory:** Architecture, data, and behavior must be structured so you (the LLM) can inspect, explain, and modify the system using the system itself.

**2. Architecture > Code:** Clear layering and durable objects matter more than code longevity. If the architecture is sound, code is replaceable.

**3. Contracts are the Source of Truth:** Guarantees and boundaries live in contracts (Schemas/APIs). Application code is secondary and should be treated as potentially disposable/regeneratable.

**4. The Stability Gradient:** * **System & Platform:** High stability, slow change, high scrutiny.

- **Applications:** High flexibility, rapid change, frequent deletion.
    

**5. Separation of Concerns:** Platform provides **capabilities** (no domain logic). Applications provide **meaning** (no platform services).

**6. No Hidden Durable State:** All durable state must be inspectable, versioned, and reachable. If it is required to understand an object's history or identity, it **must** be in the central database. Ephemeral state is allowed only for runtime performance.

**7. LLM Legibility is a Hard Constraint:** Use standard libraries, idiomatic patterns, and explicit structures. Avoid "clever" or minimal code that obscures intent. Prefer clarity over performance micro-optimizations.

**8. Deviations:** Any design violating this lens must be explicitly flagged, justified, and documented.

## ## Layer Definitions & Routing Rules

### **01. System (Access & Control)**

- **Definition:** How the system is accessed, controlled, and rebuilt.
    
- **Scope:** Trust boundaries (Auth), Operations (DevOps/Nix/Docker), and Control Surfaces (UI/ChatOps).
    
- **AI Rule:** Do not add domain or application logic here. This layer is for the "Bootstrap" and "Manual."
    

### **02. Platform (Generic Capabilities)**

- **Definition:** The common backbone used by all applications.
    
- **Scope:** Storage, ingestion, transport, scheduling, and execution support.
    
- **AI Rule:** A component is Platform if it is **reusable, persistent, and contains no domain-specific behavior.** It should not care _why_ it is being used.
    

### **03. Application (Domain & Behavior)**

- **Definition:** Where the "What" and "Why" live.
    
- **Scope:** Logic that transforms inputs into meaningful outputs (parsing, monitoring, scoring).
    
- **AI Rule:** Applications use Platform services but never provide them. They are replaceable and versionable.

## ## Architectural Implementation

### **1. Contract-First Development**

Applications are coupled to the system through **explicit contracts**, not code-level integration. Before writing application logic, you must define or reference the **shared data objects** and **platform guarantees** it will use.

### **2. Portability & Documentation**

The system must be fully rebuildable on a different machine using only this documentation and the durable data. Every configuration change must be reflected in the **System** layer documentation.


## Current Focus (Active)
- Application: WorkoutTracker
- Goal: first real end-to-end Atlas application
- Scope: Postgres-backed, contract-first, minimal executable
- Non-goals: UI polish, auth, multi-user support
